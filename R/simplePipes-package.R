#' simplePipes: A Collection Pipe Operators
#'
#' simplePipes provides a collection of lightweight pipe operators for R.
#'
#' @details
#' simplePipes is a small R package that implements a variety of simple pipe operators. 
#' It has less error checking than major R packages (like magrittr or dplyr) but contains more varieties -- 
#' both forward and backward versions of basic, tee, wye, exposition, compound assignment, and dot pipes -- 
#' and introduces the concept of through pipes. It also implements syntax that is simpler than the R native forward pipe.
